This directory contains ClassLoaderHandlers that are loaded via the ServiceLoader mechanism. ClassLoaderHandlers
are used to extract classpath elements from a ClassLoader.

ClassLoaderHandlers are registered in this service file:

    src/main/resources/META-INF/services/io.github.lukehutch.fastclasspathscanner.classpath.ClassLoaderHandler

You can register new ClassLoaderHandlers in your own jarfiles by putting a file of the same name in your own jar,
and listing the full package name of your own ClassLoaderHandler subclass in that file. Alternatively, you can
call .registerClassLoaderHandler() on your FastClasspathScanner instance before calling .scan() to manually
register your own ClassLoaderHandler. 

Note that URLClassLoader subclasses do not need a custom ClassLoaderHandler, they are handled automatically
by FastClasspathScanner.
